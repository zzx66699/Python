# Python Data Notes

This repository is my personal playground for learning **Python for data analysis** and **web scraping**.

Main topics:
- Python basics (syntax, control flow, functions)
- NumPy
- pandas (data cleaning, aggregation, join, time series)
- Data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
- Web scraping (requests, BeautifulSoup) – e.g. Dirk supermarket price scraper
- Small analysis projects

## Structure

  Jupyter notebooks for learning and experiments.  
  Organized by topic:
